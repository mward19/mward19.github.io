Researchers have spent a lot of time looking for structures in these tomograms, and save their findings in annotation files. This repository contains code that makes it easier to navigate the web of tomograms and annotations we have, simplifying analysis and dataset creation. While it\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;m still working on, I use it every day in my research, and some of my colleagues do too.\nThe code is hosted on GitHub.\nIt was my first time trying to write a full-fledged Python library. I learned how to define the dependencies of my project so users could install it without having to think about that. I think my favorite part was learning to generate a documentation site automatically from the code\u0026rsquo;s docstrings using MkDocs. Seeing it update itself as I added features was fascinating.\n","date":"13 November 2024","permalink":"/projects/tomogram-datasets/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"tomogram-datasets"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m Matthew Ward, a student in the Applied and Computational Mathematics Emphasis (ACME) program at Brigham Young University.\nI am especially interested in computer vision, optimization, and the mathematics behind data science and machine learning.\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m not studying, I like to sing my wife songs at the piano. She and I play together in a non-music-major string orchestra at BYU. We love cooking and baking too.\n","date":"13 November 2024","permalink":"/about/","section":"Home","summary":"","title":"About me"},{"content":" Applied Mathematics student at Brigham Young University ","date":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Home","summary":"","title":"Home"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
