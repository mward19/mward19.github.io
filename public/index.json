I spend a lot of time working with cryo-electron tomograms. They\u0026rsquo;re huge, noisy, three-dimensional images that can take up gigabytes of storage apiece.\nNaturally, visualizing these images is a pain—most of the options are desktop applications like IMOD. napari is marvelous, but heavier than I usually need. All the time I found myself in a Jupyter notebook working doing data analysis on tomograms and I just wanted a quick snapshot of what the volume looks like, perhaps with a couple keypoints marked. And I wanted it to be dead-simple, so that with a single function call and a few seconds I could see what sort of image I was working with. So I wrote visualize_voxels.\nIt was my first time writing a Python library. Really, calling it a library is a stretch, because it only delivers to the user one function (visualize). But because I work in many environments (on my laptop, in online Jupyter notebooks, through SSH on BYU\u0026rsquo;s supercomputer), I wanted it to be easily installable via pip.\nThe result was exactly what I needed. Given a NumPy array of scalars arr, simply calling visualize(arr) produces a visualization like the one displayed below in seconds—quick, simple, effective. Then I started adding other useful features, like the ability to mark points in the volume, and change the size, speed, and resolution of the visualization, among other little things. I made it work seamlessly in both .py scripts as well as notebooks.\nThis code (which leverages tomogram-datasets as well) visualizes the tomogram with the third-largest number of flagellar motors in our supercomputer:\nfrom tomogram_datasets import all_fm_tomograms import numpy as np from visualize_voxels import visualize as viz tomos = all_fm_tomograms() n_flagellar_motors = [len(tomo.annotation_points()) for tomo in tomos] super_tomo = tomos[np.argsort(n_flagellar_motors)[-3]] viz( super_tomo.get_data(), marks=super_tomo.annotation_points(), markalpha=0.5, axis=0, slices=np.linspace(80, 320, 100), fps=16 ) Try playing with it here.\n","date":"14 November 2024","permalink":"/projects/visualize-voxels/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"visualize-voxels"},{"content":"I would love to get in touch with you!

Researchers have spent a lot of time looking for structures in these tomograms, and save their findings in annotation files. This repository contains code that makes it easier to navigate the web of tomograms and annotations we have, simplifying analysis and dataset creation. While it\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;m still working on, I use it every day in my research, and some of my colleagues do too.\nThe code is hosted on Test.\nIt was my first time trying to write a full-fledged Python library. I learned how to define the dependencies of my project so users could install it without having to think about that. I think my favorite part was learning to generate a documentation site automatically from the code\u0026rsquo;s docstrings using MkDocs. Seeing it update itself as I added features was fascinating.\n","date":"13 November 2024","permalink":"/projects/tomogram-datasets/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"tomogram-datasets"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m Matthew Ward, a student in the Applied and Computational Mathematics Emphasis (ACME) program at Brigham Young University.\nI am especially interested in computer vision, optimization, and the mathematics behind data science and machine learning.\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m not studying, I like to sing my wife songs at the piano.
