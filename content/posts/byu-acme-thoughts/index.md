This semester, I finished the "senior core" of BYU's [Applied and Computational Mathematics Emphasis (ACME)](https://acme.byu.edu/) program. It's been an awesome journey, and since other peoples' thoughts on the internet were influential in leading me to join the program, I thought I'd share mine.

## How I ended up in ACME
I started my journey at BYU studying electrical engineering. My second semester, I took Digital Systems (EC EN 220) and Circuit Analysis (EC EN 240). At the close of the semester, as I prepared for my final exams in a windowless room on the fourth floor of the Clyde, my thoughts wandered. I really enjoyed what I was learning, but the physics class I was also taking (PHSCS 123) and conversations with my astronomy major then-girlfriend (now wife) made me wish I could explore the fundamentals more. I wanted more theory, feeling that if I thoroughly understood the theory behind what I was doing, I could go farther in the long term. I wanted to learn to *learn*, fearing I was studying techniques and tools that wouldn't be relevant in the long term.

Now, I don't think all of my thoughts were spot on. That was four years ago (early 2021), and even with the advent of ChatGPT and other LLMs, I don't think the electrical engineering skills I was learning will be irrelevant anytime soon, if ever. But it lead me down a good path. I wanted to find a way to bridge the gap between the exciting hands-on applications of electrical engineering with the rigor and theory in a program like physics. I wanted to have the deep theoretical understanding necessary to adapt to the jobs of the future, while still having useful skills today, even if some tools I learn might go obsolete.

There in the Clyde, my mind drifted. I remembered seeing a stranger wearing an ACME shirt while playing pool with my brother, and looked the program up. Reading about it on ACME's website as well as various forums, it felt right, it felt exciting! It dawned on me that such a program might fulfill my goal of bridging intense theory with application, and that mathematics is and always will be relevant in any technological field.

## My experience in the program
Soon afterwards, I left to serve as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for two years. Upon my return, ACME still felt like a good path, and I jumped right in. In my year studying electrical engineering, I'd taken all of the prerequisite math classes like linear algebra and multivariable calculus, so I just needed to take an introductory proofs class (MATH 290) and a bit of real analysis (MATH 341) to be eligible to start the "junior core" of ACME. I took them over a summer and jumped in, deciding that I didn't want to spend a whole school year to take two math classes, and that having the advanced math done earlier would probably lead to cool opportunities down the line.

The meat of the ACME program consists of the "junior core" and "senior core", which each last two semesters. Each semester students take an envelope of four interdependent classes. Two are traditional lecture classes, and two are programming lab classes with no lecture component. Most students take them all consecutively for two years, so the people you start the core with (your "cohort") are the same people you finish with. We were encouraged to take advantage of the junior and senior study rooms&mdash;two large rooms full of whiteboards and long tables, reserved for ACME juniors and seniors to collaborate on homework and projects. The homework in ACME is *intense*, especially in the junior core when it's all still new to you. In my opinion, students who didn't take advantage of these rooms missed out on what may be the most valuable part of the ACME program: the people you meet. 

I met some stupendous people in the junior and senior rooms. Yesterday morning we had our final ACME gathering, a presentation session to showcase our final data modeling projects this past semester. I realized I knew the names and personalities of just about everyone in the program... except for a few who didn't make a habit of collaborating with their peers in the ACME rooms. They missed out on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! My peers in ACME became my team, and some, my closest friends.

The program is by no means perfect. I'll list what I think are its best and worst aspects.

### What makes ACME great
- It fulfilled my expectations&mdash;a thorough treatment of mathematical theory balanced with plenty of fascinating real-world applications.
- I learned to *learn*, just as I'd hoped. (Admittedly, this probably happens in any intense university program.)
- Super cool curriculum developed by BYU faculty, supposedly unlike most applied math programs. See [information about textbooks and complete lab manuals](https://foundations-of-applied-mathematics.github.io/) and [textbooks' tables of contents](https://acme.byu.edu/textbooks-and-lab-materials).
- Faculty is very invested in the program, they're passionate about it. It's only 11 years old.
  - ACME won the [American Mathematical Society's 2024 "Award for an Exemplary Program or Achievement in a Mathematics Department"](https://www.ams.org/news?news_id=7244). Can you spot me in the picture?
- Faculty do a great job facilitating and encouraging collaboration among students. 
  - The senior core has lots of big group projects. Since I'd spent the junior core collaborating on homework in the junior room, I knew there were plenty of great people I could choose to work with on them.
- Heavy focus on employability. 
  - The math department hosts networking events regularly and practically begs you to let them help you with your resume and such
- Applications well beyond pure mathematics. See [list of ACME concentrations](https://acme.byu.edu/concentrations-in-acme).
- *Great* food haha! These folks know how it's done. Abundant Cafe Rio and Panda Express at a ton of events.
- The lab classes augment the lecture classes very well. 
  - The labs are all in Python (supposedly they were originally going to be in MATLAB! Glad that didn't happen). They introduce you to a broad array of useful Python packages (particularly NumPy, SciPy, and scikit-learn) as well as object-oriented programming. 
  - I found that the labs prepared me well for my current research job, which in turn helped me land an internship.

### What it's still working out
- Volume 4.
  - My peers and I frequently felt frustrated because "Volume 4", the book for the program's course on modeling with differential equations, is still pretty rough around the edges. Lots of typos in the textbook draft and not-so-clear explanations.
  - The homework questions in Volume 4 also didn't seem to probe deep understanding of the material, so I'm still not sure I understand it as well as I'd like.
  - I should note that Volumes 1 and 2 (the textbooks for the junior core) are superb, and have been published ([Volume 1](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611974904), [Volume 2](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611976069)), but the faculty are still working on volumes 3 and 4 (see [textbooks' tables of contents](https://acme.byu.edu/textbooks-and-lab-materials)). Volume 3 is in great shape, I'd say. Volume 4 needs some work.
- The workload can be very intense. The pressure just about breaks *everyone* at some point in their experience.
  - My wife helped me set boundaries to make sure I was taking care of myself, which worked wonderfully, but not everyone fared so well. To their credit, the faculty repeatedly encouraged everyone to put their health and well-being first, even when that meant not finishing homework. In practice, it's hard to resist staying up and instead turn in your chicken-scratch half-done hand-wavy homework when it's only 9 pm, but I learned to embrace it. I still did fine on exams.
  - The core classes technically total 8 credit hours per semester (12 credits is the minimum one has to take to keep scholarships), but took a lot more time than any other 8 credits would've. I've started telling people to schedule their semester thinking of ACME as 12 credits rather than 8, since it *will* take over your life for two years, in a sense. I sometimes wish the number of credit hours reflected the workload, although I'm aware of some reasons that such an increase in credit hours is not possible.
- Prideful attitudes.
  - It seems like this is getting less common in the program (I hope it is at least). Students in other programs, like engineering, physics, and [APEX Math](https://apex.byu.edu/what-is-apex) (BYU's more mainstream math program) often harbored some resentment for the ACME program because of prideful people they'd interacted with. I remember talking to a mechanical engineering student about ACME&mdash;he told me that he knew about the program, since a peer in one of his engineering classes was in ACME, and constantly reminded everyone in the class how easy the integrals and other tricky math concepts were for him! Nobody wants to work with a person like that, and ACME's grandiose promises ("world domination" comes to mind ðŸ˜‰) might contribute to some students having such attitudes.

<!-- A note: comparison almost ruined me. All the people who make it through ACME are stellar students. Growing up, I found that I was quick at math. I got used to being at the top of my class, and I aced math and physics exams with little real effort. In ACME, for the first time, I found myself in a community where I was entirely mediocre. I saw dozens of people all around me who seemed to understand things much faster than I could, and it was easy to want to compare myself to them. It's not worth it. There will always be people who are smarter than you in a program like this one. Although I wasn't "the best", I learned *so much*!
