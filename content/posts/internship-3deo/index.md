This summer I had the opportunity to intern with [3DEO](https://3deolidar.com/), a spin-out from MIT Lincoln Laboratory specializing in Geiger-mode lidar. Read more about 3DEO's awesome work in [this LIDAR Magazine article](https://lidarmag.com/2024/12/30/next-generation-geiger-mode-lidar-systems/). Here I will focus primarily on my contributions and what I learned.

All lidar systems work by sending out light, timing its reflection, and combining that with the sensorâ€™s position and angle to locate the target&mdash;like bats using echolocation, but with light instead of sound. Most lidar (linear-mode) uses a single sensor that measures the intensity of the returning light over time and marks the reflection time as the point where the intensity peaks. Unlike linear-mode lidar, Geiger-mode lidar uses an _array_ of detectors, each of which is sensitive to _individual photons_ rather than continuous light intensity.

Because it uses an array of detectors, the speed at which Geiger-mode lidar sensors collect data is extremely fast. When I worked with a 60 or 70 gigabyte dataset I helped create for [BYU's "Locating Bacterial Flagellar Motors 2025" Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/byu-locating-bacterial-flagellar-motors-2025), I struggled to perform any kind of processing because of the I/O bottlenecks resulting from the size of the data, but at 3DEO I worked with _terabytes_ of raw point cloud data. It is not unusual for a single data processing run to go through tens (if not hundreds) of billions of photon detections and pull them together into a single data product, easily plowing through weeks of CPU time to do so. The unique challenges I faced in my work at 3DEO pushed me to think creatively and simplify algorithms beyond the level I was used to. I learned and grew in so many ways, too many to be able to write about. I'll try to hit a few main items though.

During my time at 3DEO, I used and learned more about
- Mathematics
  - Pose graph optimization
  - Working with rotations (Euler angles, quaternions, rotation matrices, axis-angle representation)
  - Rigid body transformations (transitioning between various reference frames, pose graph optimization, ways to represent and manipulate rotations, etc.)
  - Gaussian Mixture Models
  - Bayesian inference
- Software development
  - Containers (Apptainer, Docker)
  - Collaborative Git workflow for large projects
  - High-performance computing
  - Slurm
  - SQL (MariaDB)
  - Python, C++, Julia
- Typesetting
  - \\(\LaTeX\\)
  - [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst) (I _love_ Typst!)

3DEO's code is proprietary, of course, but at the end of my internship I had the chance to present to the company on a few things I had worked on. In the following articles, I draw from that [presentation](https://github.com/mward19/3deo-internship-presentation/tree/master) to discuss some of my projects at a high level.

- In [Internship with 3DEO&mdash;Pose Graph Optimization](/projects/internship-3deo-pose-graph), I discuss the problem of merging together inconsistent pairwise alignments between point clouds to infer final alignments for a set of \\(n\\) misaligned point clouds.
- In [Internship with 3DEO&mdash;Illumination Spot Modeling](/projects/internship-3deo-spot-modeling), I highlight some challenges I faced while modeling the spot illuminated by a laser as detected by an airborne camera.
- In [Internship with 3DEO&mdash;Processing Performance Report](/projects/internship-3deo-processing-report), I give a brief overview of a program I wrote to automatically generate reports on the performance of 3DEO's extensive processing pipeline.
