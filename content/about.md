I'm Matthew Ward, a student in the <a href="https://acme.byu.edu/" target="_blank">Applied and Computational Mathematics Emphasis (ACME)</a> program at Brigham Young University. I was previously a member of the [BYU Biophysics Group](https://byu-biophysics.github.io/) and a data engineer intern working on Geiger-mode lidar at [3DEO, Inc.](https://3deo.biz/)

I focus on computer vision (especially for 3-dimensional imaging these days), optimization, and the mathematics behind data science and machine learning.

When I'm not studying, I like to sing my wife songs at the piano. She and I enjoy playing strings together and spending time in the beautiful outdoors here in Utah.
