I'm Matthew Ward, a student in the <a href="https://acme.byu.edu/" target="_blank">Applied and Computational Mathematics Emphasis (ACME)</a> program at Brigham Young University.

I am especially interested in computer vision, optimization, and the mathematics behind data science and machine learning.

When I'm not studying, I like to sing my wife songs at the piano. She and I play together in a non-music-major string orchestra at BYU. We love cooking and baking too.
